# 2048_game
A really simple implementation of 2048 in Python.

Right now it's just a simple console based game. If I have the time, there are plans to code a visual interface and also implement some algorithm to self-play the game.

Some progress has been made to the self-playing aspect of the game. Right now what's left is to figure out and balance the factors that affect the score of a particular configuration of the game. I suspect that will take quite a lot of work, if done correctly.
